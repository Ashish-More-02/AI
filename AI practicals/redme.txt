*greedy algorithm 

it chooses the locally optimum solution with the inent to finding the globally optimum solution .

feasable soultion = available choices

optimal solution = chosing the best solution out of available solution .

*selection sort 

in this we have unsorted array , and we have to make it sorted by using greedy algorithm

1) first we have to select the minimun number out of array and place it in the first position 
2)
